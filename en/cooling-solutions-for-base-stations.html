              Mobair co-operates with professionals in the construction and HVAC industry. We provide 48 V DC fans for demanding professional cooling applications in base stations. Fans are waiting ready on stand-by and connected to back up batteries on the site of base stations.

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              The cooling of a technical space e.g. base station is provided by an air conditioner or free flowing fans. When the outside temperature is lower than inside, fans are used for cooling.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
              The control system directs the operation of fans and AC units optimally for lowest possible energy consumption. Surveillance and alert systems are easy to add.
