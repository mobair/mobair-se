              An air-source heat pump circles indoor air without improving its oxygen levels but only its temperature. A supply air valve on the other hand improves not only temperature but also oxygen levels by bringing in cleaned, healthy and fresh outside air

            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
              It is the incoming fresh air which replaces the old air that exits typically from the kitchen, bathroom etc. It is very important that the incoming fresh air is pre-heated and filtered.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
              You must install a suitable air supply fan in a room where the ventilation needs to be improved. You can install an air supply fan into every room, or just to the ones that have ventilation problems. For example in homes, bedrooms are the most important rooms to have good air quality to facilitate good sleep and well-being.

              Mobair 2030S air supply fan is very energy efficient and approximately uses only 1.0 W. Mobair 2010 and 2015 air supply heaters that have a dedicated heating element, use approximately 200 W on average. However, electricity used by the air supply heaters is compensated by smaller heating costs in general as the pre-heated supply air lessens the workload of other heating sources, e.g. radiators.

              Do air supply fans interfere with the buildings existing ventilation system?

            <!-- Text -->
            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-0">
              No. Air supply fans do not interfere with any existing ventilation system. However, it is required in apartment buildings as well as other buildings that air supply fans must not cause positive air pressure indoors. All Mobair products have specifically been designed to prevent this from happening, and the authorities have approved all Mobair systems.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              All Mobair fans are very silent. This makes them ideal solutions for bedrooms; since sleep will not be disturbed by noises and fresh air supply will further facilitate good sleep. Acoustical noise for the models Mobair 2015 and 2030S is less than 27 dB(A). Our air supply fans are so silent that e.g. radiators can make more noise than the fan itself.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
              In addition, a silencer (AV2000) can be installed inside of the air duct to further reduce incoming outside noises in urban areas.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
              Yes. It is very usual to use both of these devices at the same time. An air supply fan can only improve air quality.

              It is recommended to use the original filters sold by Mobair or an authorized reseller to ensure the original intended operation (e.g. the correct air volume) of the product. You can find the nearest authorized MOBAIR reseller <a href="{% link en/resellers.html %}">here</a>.
